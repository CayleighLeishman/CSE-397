**SMART Goals Research:**

The sources I used for this assingment is theses three:
*1) [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals)
*2) [Isix](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/smart/)*
*3) [MsCottonsCorner->YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwIZwIIv10)*
*4) [KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/learnstorm-growth-mindset-activities-us/elementary-and-middle-school-activities/setting-goals/v/learnstorm-growth-mindset-how-to-write-a-smart-goal)*


The purpose of the Acrynymn SMART is to helo us "feel more motivated to learn and grow" [3]. It breaks down how to make and more importantly maintain Goals in your lives. 

The Smarts Acronymn Stands for:
Specfic
Measurable 
Acheivable
Relevant
Time-bound

**Specific** means that it has a straightforward and leaves little room for interpretation. So instead of saying "I want to be able to add more Users to the database." You boil it down to "I want to add 150 Users to the database. 

**Measurable** after reviewing the difference sources, I took to mean "Results you can see the progress of." This allows you to track the outcome a little more easily and get to the nitty gritty before it gets too confusing. If it does get confusing then you can see it pretty quickly, and know it needs to be readjusted.

**Acheivable** This just means "a goal you can actually accomplish." Though we do need to streach ourselves, espeicilly for this course and in the feild, we need to make sure it's within the rhelmn of possibilities that we can sccessfully acheive,

**Relavant** I like to rephrase this as "relevant" to the goal. If you know you need to mow the lawn you're not going to prepare how to make dishes. Thats inside work. You want to prepare the lawn, which may include bringing dishes on the lawn inside, but not starting the dishwasher. 

**Time-Bound** This focuses on making goals that you can accomplish in a timephrame. this means being on the same page with your team on when things will get done, and ensuring that what we want to acheive can be done within the time that we need to get things done. 


While I did the reading/watched videos I found My favourite line which was from Khan Academy: There it says
"keep working through your frusterations by using the right learning strategies" [4]
I don't know about everyone, but for me I know that I can get frusterated when I'm not understanding the material after a long period of time. So this can serve as a helpful reminder for us that we will get frusterated, but we need to impliment the right strategies to get through it. 

**Resume Improvements:**
 Look at 3-4 other classmatesâ€™ posts and identify 2-4 items that you think are novel approaches to improving your resume or LinkedIn Profile.

*Resume:*
1) 
2) 
 
*Linkedin profile:*

I liked seeing some of the big projects that one of the students posted. 
 1) Add in big meaningful projects I've done into LinkedIn
 2) Have a more professional Profile Picture




**Job Posting & Evaluation:**

 Find 3-4 jobs that you would like have applied or recommend. Provide links. And why are they good matches. Evaluate them.

 This is for Web Development, I could apply of all the techniques I learned throughout the last few semesters. I love their motto "Doing good where good is needed." I mainly looked into this at first because of the location (Idaho Falls,) but they seem to have good standards and I beleive its a good companay to work for. 

(Church of Jesus Christ UX Design )[https://epej.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/requisitions/preview/362898/?keyword=Web+development&mode=job-location]

This is for front end position. Since I have a growing interest in UI Design, this could be a great opportunity for me to learn new techniques that I haven't yet got the chance to learn yet. I could see how UX design is applied in the real world. I also like the idea of having an impact on the Church outside of being an Disciple of Christ. 

(Digital Accessibility)[https://epej.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/requisitions/preview/362898/?keyword=Web+development&mode=job-location] 

Since I have a growing interest in Accessibility through Web browsers, this could have been a great place to see different accessibility features and see different Unversity cultures across the United States. 

**Equivalent:**

 what elements of the jobs are equivalent to what you already know? Equivalents could be languages, skills, CASE (computer-aided software environments, i.e., IDEs), tools, or techniques

 Vast majority of these require some staple of 
 *HTML (and some accessibility tools)
 *CSS (And some accessibility tools)
 *Javascript
 *Self Motivated
 *Work Wtih Chatgbt (Honestly since the professor mentioned that working with Chatgbt is a growing  demand in some workplaces, I've realized how many Jobs and internships where I've read that also have this as a Qualification. That was news to me.)
 *Detail Oriented
 *Works independantly


**Improvements:**

 What elements do you think you could find out and learn about? (example could be domain knowledge, software, Third-party packages)

 I could do more work to see what IDE each company uses. I never really thought to look into that, but that could be a great way to expand my expereince. Seeing IDE's of different companies may also help me see which IDE;s the common donominator and maybe get some practice with their IDE's. Or at least be wiling to work with it. 


**SMART Goals:**

From the previous task, Job Posting & Evaluation, identify a common thread of Improvements. Include a list of classmates that you looked at. (For example: What are some standard search engines? What makes a good match? What equivalent comparisons of languages, tools, and techniques? What are we missing?)

**Create two S.M.A.R.T. goals**

(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time), one based on what you learned from your fellow classmates, and one from job search.
