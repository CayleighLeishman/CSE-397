*Resume:*
1) 
2) 
 
*Linkedin profile:*

 1) Add in big meaningful projects I've done into LinkedIn
 2) Have a more professional Profile Picture




**Job Posting & Evaluation:**

 Find 3-4 jobs that you would like have applied or recommend. Provide links. And why are they good matches. Evaluate them.


**Equivalent:**

 what elements of the jobs are equivalent to what you already know? Equivalents could be languages, skills, CASE (computer-aided software environments, i.e., IDEs), tools, or techniques

**Improvements:**

 What elements do you think you could find out and learn about? (example could be domain knowledge, software, Third-party packages)


**SMART Goals:**

From the previous task, Job Posting & Evaluation, identify a common thread of Improvements. Include a list of classmates that you looked at. (For example: What are some standard search engines? What makes a good match? What equivalent comparisons of languages, tools, and techniques? What are we missing?)

**Create two S.M.A.R.T. goals**

(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time), one based on what you learned from your fellow classmates, and one from job search.
