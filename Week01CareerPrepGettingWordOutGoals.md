**SMART Goals Research:**

The sources I used for this assignment are these three:

*1) [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals)

*2) [Isix](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/smart/)*

*3) [MsCottonsCorner->YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwIZwIIv10)*

*4) [KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/learnstorm-growth-mindset-activities-us/elementary-and-middle-school-activities/setting-goals/v/learnstorm-growth-mindset-how-to-write-a-smart-goal)*


The acronym "SMART" is meant to help us "feel more motivated to learn and grow" [3]. It breaks down how to make and more importantly, maintain Goals in your lives. 

The Smarts Acronymn Stands for:
Specific
Measurable 
Achievable
Relevant
Time-bound

**Specific** means it is straightforward and leaves little room for interpretation. So instead of saying "I want to be able to add more Users to the database." You boil it down to "I want to add 150 Users to the database. 

**Measurable** After reviewing the different sources, I took this to mean "Results you can see the progress of." This allows you to track the outcome a little more easily and get to the nitty-gritty before it gets too confusing. If it does get confusing then you can see it pretty quickly, and know it needs to be readjusted.

**Acheivable** This means "a goal you can fully accomplish." Though we do need to stretch ourselves, especially for this course and in the field, we need to make sure it's within the range of possibilities that we can successfully achieve,

**Relevant** I like to rephrase this as "relevant" to the goal. If you know you need to mow the lawn you're not going to prepare how to make dishes. That's inside work. You want to prepare the lawn, which may include bringing dishes on the lawn inside, but not starting the dishwasher. 

**Time-Bound** This focuses on making goals that you can accomplish in a time frame. this means being on the same page with your team on when things will get done, and ensuring that what we want to achieve can be done within the time that we need to get things done. 

While I did the reading/watched videos I found My favourite line which was from Khan Academy. There it says: 
"keep working through your frustrations by using the right learning strategies" [4]
I don't know about everyone, but I know I can get frustrated when I'm not understanding the material after a long time. So this can serve as a helpful reminder for us that we will get frustrated, but we need to implement the right strategies to get through it. We make do with what we've got and move forward the best we can. 

**Resume Improvements:**
 Look at 3-4 other classmates’ posts and identify 2-4 items that you think are novel approaches to improving your resume or LinkedIn Profile.

*Resume:*
1) Focus on the layout 
2) Utilize bullet points more
3) Simplify the resume more. 
 
*Linkedin profile:*

 1) Add in big meaningful projects I've done into LinkedIn
 2) Have a more professional Profile Picture



**Job Posting & Evaluation:**

If I had to take the opportunity to apply for jobs now I would probably look at these four. 

 [Melaleuca](https://studentcareers-melaleuca.icims.com/jobs/6464/internship-2025---software-development/job?mobile=false&width=1030&height=16727&bga=true&needsRedirect=false&jan1offset=-420&jun1offset=-360)

 This is for Web Development, I could apply of all the techniques I learned throughout the last few semesters. I love their motto "Doing good where good is needed." I mainly looked into this at first because of the location (Idaho Falls,) but they seem to have good standards and I beleive its a good companay to work for. 

[Church of Jesus Christ UX Design](https://epej.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/requisitions/preview/362898/?keyword=Web+development&mode=job-location)

This is for front end position. Since I have a growing interest in UI Design, this could be a great opportunity for me to learn new techniques that I haven't yet got the chance to learn yet. I could see how UX design is applied in the real world. I also like the idea of having an impact on the Church outside of being an Disciple of Christ. 

[Digital Accessibility](https://epej.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/requisitions/preview/362898/?keyword=Web+development&mode=job-location)

Since I have a growing interest in Accessibility through Web browsers, this could have been a great place to see different accessibility features implemented in Web Design. 

**Equivalent:**

 In these jobs a lot of the Stuff I know I can do are as follows:
 
 *HTML 
 *CSS 
 *Javascript
 *Adaptability
 *Self Motivated
 *Work With Chatgbt (Honestly, since the professor mentioned that working with Chatgbt is a growing  demand in some workplaces, I've 
 realized how many Jobs and internships also have this as a Qualification. That was news to me.)
 *Detail Oriented
 *Team Collaboration
 

**Improvements:**

 Something I could probably learn and find out more about is to see what IDE each company uses. I never really thought to look into that, but that could be a great way to expand my experience. Seeing IDEs of different companies may also help me see which IDE's the common denominators and maybe get some practice with their IDEs. Or at least be willing to work with it. 

  Something I'm not familiar with though would be accessibility techniques outside of Alt Text. So, I can see if there are new ways to learn techniques or information about how that's done. There could be other packages that we can use to utilize our coding efficiency time but remain accessible. I'm not sure yet. 


**SMART Goals:**

*Improvements*

I looked over these students for ideas on how to improve my resume/Linkedin. 
* (Jackson Westover:)[https://github.com/jcwestover/CSE-397/blob/main/Week01CareerPrepGettingWordOutIntro.md]
* (Brycen Williams:)[https://github.com/Brycenjwill/cse-397/blob/main/Week01CareerPrepGettingWordOutIntro.md]
* (Mabel Heiner) [https://github.com/mabelheiner/cse-397/blob/main/Week01CareerPrepGettingWordOutIntro.md]

Things I've learned from them:

*About Resume:* 

The main thing I noticed was the layout of their resume. I struggle to know how to space things out in my resume, so following their layout may help me narrow down what is essential to share on one page. 

(One example of formatting: I had my languages and soft skills off to the left, while most of them would include the skills under a project, or in their header.Just as long as it's not off to the side.) 

Also, I would get rid of the blue and just stick with the black colour and try for a format and layout similar to their resume. 

Other things: 

* Utilize bullet points
* Put contact under my name across the page rather than in a corner. 
* Someone also shared a note about putting more recent projects on my resume.

Something all of the students seem to do differently is where they put different sections. (For example: some Students put their Education at the top rather than showcasing their projects first.) 

*About LinkedIn/Cover Letter:*

* Be Professional, but add a personal touch. (show your drive, share your passions and be curious.)
* Don’t shy away from posting about projects. (especially if you work on a personal project) 


**Create two S.M.A.R.T. goals**

 What I learned From classmate:

Something that stood out from the student introductions was how each person seemed to have a real passion or drive for something. I know my passion lies with accessibility, but I haven’t had the chance to go beyond the basic accessibility features of ALT text. With my current course load, I’m not sure I’ll be able to code accessibility features just yet. However, because accessibility is something I care about, I will start by learning three key forms of website accessibility that could be integrated into our team project. By the end of the semester, I’ll write an 800-1,200 word summary about what I’ve learned and how these techniques can be applied to make our project more accessible moving forward. 

Job Search:

By the end of the semester, I will add 15 new LinkedIn connections. 

This is a goal that I can achieve with my busy schedule and will help me expand my professional network while being informed about the ever-evolving industry. Not only that, but it will encourage me to engage with more professionals in the field and foster connections that can support my future career development.
