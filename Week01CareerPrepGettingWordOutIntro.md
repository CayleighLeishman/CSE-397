Name: Cayleigh Leishman

Background: 

My name is Cayleigh Leishman, and I’m currently a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho, with growing experience in Front-Stack Development. Over the past few years, I’ve learned to narrow my focus to a few key programming languages. I had the opportunity to create a website for a small quilting business, which gave me hands-on experience with HTML and CSS. Currently, I’m working on deepening my understanding of JavaScript to build more dynamic and user-friendly websites. I’m excited to continue growing my skillset and contribute to this class by applying my strengths in Website Development.


Home: 

I was born in USA, Idaho and then moved to Canada, Alberta when I was about three years old. 


Interests: 

I love playing around with CSS and getting comfortable with it. I have strong organizational skills, which have been great in helping me and my teammates keep on track and gain a better understanding of each other. I have a developing intrest in the UI design of things, especially how to make it more accessible to the consumers who will acess to websitse. I have lots to learn but I'm excited to learn more!

Unique: 

I lost my hearing when I was about five years old, so I use a Cochlear Implant to help me understand those around me. It’s not perfect which is where my strong organizational and communicative skills can come in handy. I also know ASL and occationally attend Church where we use ASL to strengthen my ASL skills and sense of community.

[Resume:](https://github.com/CayleighLeishman/cse-397/blob/main/Resume.pdf)

Three things I did to make my resume unique:
  
* I added a couple projects to the resume 
* I put my projects in the top instead of at the bottom of my page, priritizing the work I've done over the education and my work expereince since I don't have a lot of experience in the feild.
* I put the languages to the side rather than just talk about what languages I used in the description of the projects 


While I'm proud of what I've been able to do I recognize that I still have a lot of growig to do. First off these projects are 2 years old so they don't showcase some of my newfound coding skills. I kept them in because as side from a Chamber project I did last semester, they were the most completed project I had in my collection. 


[Cover Letter:](https://github.com/CayleighLeishman/cse-397/blob/main/cover-letter-cse-397.pdf)


I was always told that a cover letter should be personal to the Company you're writing to. I wasn't entirely sure who to referene in the letter.
